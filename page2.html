  <h1>Elon Musk and Ukraine President Meet Up</h1>
</div>

<div style="background-color: grey; text-align:center;">
  <p>As the war is going on between Russia and Ukraine, Elon Musk is willing to help Ukraine fight and save civilians from russia. He is going to set up camps near the edges of Ukraine and some in Ukraine. In the tents there are going to be 1 or 2 doctors and guards to protect them. These doctors will treat soldiers and civilians that got injured due to war. He will also use some of his bullet proof cars and trucks to evacuate civilians and take them to neighboring countries. If needed he may also bring in helicopters for evacuation. Elon musk is not doing this for free though. In return he is going to get lots of land to make factories for tesla cars and land to blast rocket ships. In an interview with a Ukraine news channel Elon Musk said “I want the war to stop and make sure civilians don't get hurt so I will help Ukraine win this war”. Ukraines war chief said”Elon Musk's help means a lot to all of us and this can save Ukraine or at least avoid many casualties”.</p>
